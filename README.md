# Tweet-Filter-er
This bot is able to live stream Tweets from multiple Twitter accounts that are specified. When a Tweet comes through one can use this template to add their own keyword filtering or any data processing they wish to do with a tweet. The only limitation is to be aware of the [filter stream api limits](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits)

This bot utilises the new [Twitter v2 API live stream](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/stream-tweets-in-real-time)
